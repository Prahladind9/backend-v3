## AI vs ML vs DS

#### AI
Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science,
where the goal is to enable computers & machines to perform
human-like tasks and simulate human behaviour
#### ML
Machine learning is a subdomain of computer science
that focuses on algorithms which help a computer learn
from data without explicit programming ...
[Simpler]
ML is subset of AI that tries to solve a specific
problem and make predictions using data
#### DS
Data science is a field that attempts to find pattens 
and draw insights from data (might use ML!)

### Types of ML
- Supervised learning; uses labeled inputs 
(meaning the input has a corresponding output label)
to train models and learn outputs
  - Qualitative; categorical data
    - Nominal data 
      - no inherent order 
      - one-hot encoding
    - Ordinal data
      - has an inherent order
  - Quantitative; numerical valued data
    - could be discrete or continuous

Feature vector > Model > Output (prediction)

   - Predictions
      - classification: predict discrete classes i.e., multiclass, binary 
      - regression: predict continuous values

   - dataset; training, validation, testing > loss

  - Preparing data
  - K-nearest neighbors
     - lets define distance and classify some points
        - euclidean distance 

- Unsupervised learning: uses unlabeled data to learn
about patterns in data
- Reinforcement learning: agent learning in interactive
environment based on rewards and penalties

### Ordinal data

### Ordinal data
has an inherent order
